# Music-recommendation-system
By using music recommender system, the music provider can predict and then offer the appropriate songs to
their users. There are two types of approaches namely, collaborative and content-based
filtering. A combination of both the approaches will also help us provide a better solution. The
primary objective of this project is to create a music recommendation system that caters to
individual preferences, ensuring that users discover new music that resonates with their tastes.
